# Instructions for Next Agent

## Current Status
We've created a complete Colab automation system for generating gorilla playing squash images using FLUX LoRA, but **haven't tested it yet**. The system is ready to test.

## What Was Built
1. **FLUX LoRA Workflow**: `user/default/workflows/flux_lora_tutorial_workflow.json` - Main workflow for gorilla generation
2. **Working Colab Notebook**: `comfyui_fixed_final.ipynb` - Uses localtunnel (no auth required)
3. **Google API Integration**: Service account key and upload system (key is local only)
4. **Documentation**: Complete guides and setup instructions

## Next Steps - TEST THE SYSTEM

### Step 1: Test the Colab Notebook
1. **Upload** `comfyui_fixed_final.ipynb` to Google Colab
2. **Run all cells** (takes 5-10 minutes)
3. **Look for localtunnel URL** in output (like `https://xxxxx.loca.lt`)
4. **Open that URL** to access ComfyUI GUI

### Step 2: Test Gorilla Generation
1. **Load workflow**: `user/default/workflows/flux_lora_tutorial_workflow.json`
2. **Verify prompt**: Should be "A majestic tiger in a lush jungle, detailed fur, golden eyes, photorealistic"
3. **Change prompt** to: "A gorilla playing squash, athletic pose, detailed fur, intense focus, photorealistic"
4. **Generate image** and verify it works

### Step 3: Test Automation (if GUI works)
1. **Run**: `python3 gorilla_automation.py` 
2. **Verify** it can upload notebooks automatically
3. **Test** the auto-updater system

## Key Files to Use
- **Main notebook**: `comfyui_fixed_final.ipynb` (this is the working one)
- **Workflow**: `user/default/workflows/flux_lora_tutorial_workflow.json`
- **Automation**: `gorilla_automation.py`
- **Guides**: `COLAB_CLI_GUIDE.md`, `READY_TO_USE.md`

## Expected Issues
- **ngrok auth**: Fixed by using localtunnel
- **Service account limits**: May need alternative approach
- **Colab timeouts**: May need to restart cells

## Success Criteria
✅ ComfyUI GUI accessible via localtunnel URL  
✅ Gorilla image generated successfully  
✅ Automation system works without manual uploads  

## If Issues Arise
- Check `docs/session_summary.md` for previous solutions
- Use the auto-updater system to fix notebook issues
- Fall back to manual notebook upload if needed

**Goal**: Generate a gorilla playing squash image using FLUX LoRA on Colab GPU with minimal user intervention.
