**What we did:** Created clean Python virtual environment, installed compatible coverage==6.5.0 and numba==0.58.1, successfully loaded WAS Node Suite (220 nodes).

**Issues faced:** Package conflicts between numba/coverage versions causing AttributeError: module 'coverage' has no attribute 'types'.

**Resolution:** Virtual environment with isolated dependencies resolved compatibility issues. ComfyUI running with all WAS nodes available.

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 11:12 AM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully installed ComfyUI with all required dependencies, PyTorch MPS support, and multiple custom node packs including WAS Node Suite (220 nodes), ComfyUI-GGUF, rgthree-comfy, UltimateSDUpscale, and others.

**Issues faced:** SSL certificate verification errors prevented UltimateSDUpscale from downloading external resources, and port conflicts occurred when restarting ComfyUI instances.

**Resolution attempts:** Fixed SSL issues by installing Python certificates, updated WAS Node Suite, installed ComfyUI-GGUF for Seed Generator nodes, properly managed ComfyUI process restarts, and installed the correct ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension by farizrifqi.

**Remaining issues:** ~~The "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes are still missing from the GUI despite all custom node packs being installed and loaded successfully.~~ **RESOLVED:** Installed the correct "ComfyUI-Image-Saver" extension by farizrifqi which provides both missing nodes. Both nodes are now available in the ComfyUI interface.

# Session Summary - Update

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 11:26 AM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully resolved the missing "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes by installing the correct ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension by farizrifqi. The extension loaded successfully (0.0 seconds) and both nodes are now registered and available in the ComfyUI interface.

**Issues faced:** The nodes were missing because they were not part of WAS Node Suite or ComfyUI core, but rather from a specific "ComfyUI-Image-Saver" extension that needed to be installed separately.

**Resolution:** 
- Installed ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension: `git clone https://github.com/farizrifqi/ComfyUI-Image-Saver.git`
- Installed required dependency: `pip install piexif`
- Updated Python packages: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools pillow numpy`
- Restarted ComfyUI to load the new extension

**Current status:** All nodes are now available and working. ComfyUI is running successfully on port 8188 with all custom node packs loaded.
