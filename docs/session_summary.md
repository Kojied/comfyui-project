# Session Summary

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 11:12 AM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully installed ComfyUI with all required dependencies, PyTorch MPS support, and multiple custom node packs including WAS Node Suite (220 nodes), ComfyUI-GGUF, rgthree-comfy, UltimateSDUpscale, and others.

**Issues faced:** SSL certificate verification errors prevented UltimateSDUpscale from downloading external resources, and port conflicts occurred when restarting ComfyUI instances.

**Resolution attempts:** Fixed SSL issues by installing Python certificates, updated WAS Node Suite, installed ComfyUI-GGUF for Seed Generator nodes, and properly managed ComfyUI process restarts.

**Remaining issues:** The "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes are still missing from the GUI despite all custom node packs being installed and loaded successfully.
