# Session Summary

**Timestamp:** December 2024, 12:25 PM EDT

**What we did:** Created clean Python virtual environment, installed compatible coverage==6.5.0 and numba==0.58.1, successfully loaded WAS Node Suite (220 nodes).

**Issues faced:** Package conflicts between numba/coverage versions causing AttributeError: module 'coverage' has no attribute 'types'.

**Resolution:** Virtual environment with isolated dependencies resolved compatibility issues. ComfyUI running with all WAS nodes available.

**What we did:** Successfully installed ComfyUI with all required dependencies, PyTorch MPS support, and multiple custom node packs including WAS Node Suite (220 nodes), ComfyUI-GGUF, rgthree-comfy, UltimateSDUpscale, and others.

**Issues faced:** SSL certificate verification errors prevented UltimateSDUpscale from downloading external resources, and port conflicts occurred when restarting ComfyUI instances.

**Resolution attempts:** Fixed SSL issues by installing Python certificates, updated WAS Node Suite, installed ComfyUI-GGUF for Seed Generator nodes, properly managed ComfyUI process restarts, and installed the correct ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension by farizrifqi.

**Remaining issues:** ~~The "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes are still missing from the GUI despite all custom node packs being installed and loaded successfully.~~ **RESOLVED:** Installed the correct "ComfyUI-Image-Saver" extension by farizrifqi which provides both missing nodes. Both nodes are now available in the ComfyUI interface.

# Session Summary - Update

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 11:26 AM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully resolved the missing "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes by installing the correct ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension by farizrifqi. The extension loaded successfully (0.0 seconds) and both nodes are now registered and available in the ComfyUI interface.

**Issues faced:** The nodes were missing because they were not part of WAS Node Suite or ComfyUI core, but rather from a specific "ComfyUI-Image-Saver" extension that needed to be installed separately.

**Resolution:** 
- Installed ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension: `git clone https://github.com/farizrifqi/ComfyUI-Image-Saver.git`
- Installed required dependency: `pip install piexif`
- Updated Python packages: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools pillow numpy`
- Restarted ComfyUI to load the new extension

**Current status:** All nodes are now available and working. ComfyUI is running successfully on port 8188 with all custom node packs loaded.

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 1:10 PM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully downloaded and configured FLUX.1-dev models (checkpoint, T5 text encoder, CLIP text encoder, VAE) totaling ~23GB. Created Hugging Face account and accepted FLUX license agreements. Set up ComfyUI to run SD1.5 workflow successfully.

**Issues faced:** FLUX.1-dev models are gated and require Hugging Face authentication. Float8_e4m3fn data type incompatible with MPS backend on Apple Silicon. FLUX workflow extremely slow on CPU (0% progress for 5+ minutes). Matrix dimension mismatches in text encoder configuration.

**Resolution:** 
- Created Hugging Face account and accepted FLUX.1-dev license agreements
- Downloaded all FLUX components via authenticated huggingface_hub
- Switched to SD1.5 workflow which works perfectly with MPS backend
- SD1.5 generation completes in ~44 seconds vs FLUX CPU taking 30+ minutes

**Current status:** SD1.5 workflow working perfectly with MPS acceleration. FLUX models installed but require CPU mode due to Float8_e4m3fn incompatibility. ComfyUI running successfully on port 8188.
