# Session Summary

**Timestamp:** December 2024, 12:25 PM EDT

**What we did:** Created clean Python virtual environment, installed compatible coverage==6.5.0 and numba==0.58.1, successfully loaded WAS Node Suite (220 nodes).

**Issues faced:** Package conflicts between numba/coverage versions causing AttributeError: module 'coverage' has no attribute 'types'.

**Resolution:** Virtual environment with isolated dependencies resolved compatibility issues. ComfyUI running with all WAS nodes available.

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 11:12 AM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully installed ComfyUI with all required dependencies, PyTorch MPS support, and multiple custom node packs including WAS Node Suite (220 nodes), ComfyUI-GGUF, rgthree-comfy, UltimateSDUpscale, and others.

**Issues faced:** SSL certificate verification errors prevented UltimateSDUpscale from downloading external resources, and port conflicts occurred when restarting ComfyUI instances.

**Resolution attempts:** Fixed SSL issues by installing Python certificates, updated WAS Node Suite, installed ComfyUI-GGUF for Seed Generator nodes, properly managed ComfyUI process restarts, and installed the correct ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension by farizrifqi.

**Remaining issues:** ~~The "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes are still missing from the GUI despite all custom node packs being installed and loaded successfully.~~ **RESOLVED:** Installed the correct "ComfyUI-Image-Saver" extension by farizrifqi which provides both missing nodes. Both nodes are now available in the ComfyUI interface.

# Session Summary - Update

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 11:26 AM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully resolved the missing "Seed Generator (Image Saver)" and "Image Saver" nodes by installing the correct ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension by farizrifqi. The extension loaded successfully (0.0 seconds) and both nodes are now registered and available in the ComfyUI interface.

**Issues faced:** The nodes were missing because they were not part of WAS Node Suite or ComfyUI core, but rather from a specific "ComfyUI-Image-Saver" extension that needed to be installed separately.

**Resolution:** 
- Installed ComfyUI-Image-Saver extension: `git clone https://github.com/farizrifqi/ComfyUI-Image-Saver.git`
- Installed required dependency: `pip install piexif`
- Updated Python packages: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools pillow numpy`
- Restarted ComfyUI to load the new extension

**Current status:** All nodes are now available and working. ComfyUI is running successfully on port 8188 with all custom node packs loaded.

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 1:10 PM EDT

**What we did:** Successfully downloaded and configured FLUX.1-dev models (checkpoint, T5 text encoder, CLIP text encoder, VAE) totaling ~23GB. Created Hugging Face account and accepted FLUX license agreements. Set up ComfyUI to run SD1.5 workflow successfully.

**Issues faced:** FLUX.1-dev models are gated and require Hugging Face authentication. Float8_e4m3fn data type incompatible with MPS backend on Apple Silicon. FLUX workflow extremely slow on CPU (0% progress for 5+ minutes). Matrix dimension mismatches in text encoder configuration.

**Resolution:** 
- Created Hugging Face account and accepted FLUX.1-dev license agreements
- Downloaded all FLUX components via authenticated huggingface_hub
- Switched to SD1.5 workflow which works perfectly with MPS backend
- SD1.5 generation completes in ~44 seconds vs FLUX CPU taking 30+ minutes

**Current status:** SD1.5 workflow working perfectly with MPS acceleration. FLUX models installed but require CPU mode due to Float8_e4m3fn incompatibility. ComfyUI running successfully on port 8188.

**Timestamp:** October 10, 2025, 3:00 PM EDT

**What we did:** Converted SD1.5 text-to-image workflow to image-to-image workflow, attempted FLUX FP16 setup, and tested image transformation capabilities.

**Issues faced:** FLUX FP16 complexity with separate UNet, CLIP-L, and T5 components requiring different loaders. ComfyUI-GGUF nodes needed for .gguf files but workflow setup is complex. FLUX T5 text encoder only available in FP8 format which is incompatible with MPS backend on Apple Silicon.

**Resolution:** 
- Created image-to-image workflow using SD1.5 checkpoint with LoadImage â†’ VAEEncode â†’ KSampler â†’ VAEDecode â†’ SaveImage
- Set denoise strength to 0.75 for moderate image transformation
- Installed gguf package for ComfyUI-GGUF compatibility
- Downloaded FLUX FP16 checkpoint (22GB) but missing FP16 T5 text encoder

**Current status:** SD1.5 image-to-image workflow functional but quality is insufficient for desired results. FLUX FP16 setup incomplete due to missing FP16 T5 text encoder. ComfyUI running successfully on port 8188 with MPS acceleration.

**Goal:** Generate a gorilla playing squash image using FLUX LoRA workflow on Google Colab with GPU acceleration, controlled via CLI without user intervention.

**Problem:** Local ComfyUI lacks GPU power for FLUX generation. Need automated Colab setup with ComfyUI GUI access via tunneling.

**Issues faced:** Service account storage quota limits, ngrok authentication failures, repeated notebook uploads for fixes.

**Resolution:** Created automated Colab notebook upload system with Google API credentials, fixed ngrok auth issues by switching to localtunnel, created working notebook `comfyui_fixed_final.ipynb`.

**Current status:** Working notebook created with localtunnel tunneling (no auth required). Ready for Colab upload and ComfyUI GUI access.

**Timestamp:** October 16, 2025, 8:00 PM EDT

**Goal:** Successfully access ComfyUI GUI on Google Colab with GPU acceleration for gorilla image generation.

**What we did:** 
- Created official ComfyUI Colab notebook following the official guide
- Tested multiple tunneling methods (localtunnel, cloudflared, iframe)
- Diagnosed and resolved multiple technical issues

**Issues faced:** 
- JSON syntax errors in notebook creation (fixed)
- ComfyUI failing to start due to missing GPU (resolved by enabling GPU in Colab)
- Localtunnel password authentication issues (localtunnel requires public IP as password)
- Port conflicts from previous ComfyUI instances (port 8188 already in use)
- Node.js installation failures in Colab environment

**Resolution:** 
- Fixed JSON formatting in notebook creation
- Enabled GPU in Colab runtime (T4/A100)
- Switched from localtunnel to cloudflared (no password required)
- Created process cleanup code to kill existing ComfyUI instances
- Developed comprehensive debugging code with detailed error reporting

**Current status:** 
- âœ… ComfyUI successfully running on Colab with GPU (NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB)
- âœ… Cloudflared tunnel method ready for testing
- âœ… Process cleanup code created to resolve port conflicts
- ðŸ”„ **NEXT STEP:** Test the cloudflared tunnel code to get working ComfyUI GUI access

**Next Steps:**
1. Copy the cloudflared tunnel code into Colab
2. Run the code to get working ComfyUI GUI URL
3. Load gorilla workflow and generate images
4. Test the complete end-to-end gorilla image generation process

**Timestamp:** October 16, 2025, 9:15 PM EDT

**Goal:** Successfully run ComfyUI on Google Colab with public URL access for gorilla image generation.

**What we did:**
- Researched cloudflared tunnel issues in Colab (found it's a known problem)
- Discovered Pinggy tunneling service as a reliable alternative
- Created comprehensive Pinggy tutorial guide based on official documentation
- Updated notebook to use Pinggy method instead of cloudflared/localtunnel

**Issues faced:**
- Cloudflared tunnel getting stuck at "starting tunnel" (known Colab limitation)
- ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pinggy' (import before installation)
- ComfyUI startup failing due to wrong directory path

**Resolution:**
- Switched to Pinggy tunneling service (specifically designed for Colab)
- Fixed import order: install pinggy first, then import
- Corrected ComfyUI startup path: `!cd ComfyUI && python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0`
- Created step-by-step installation process

**Current status:**
- âœ… **SUCCESS!** ComfyUI running on Google Colab with T4 GPU
- âœ… **SUCCESS!** Pinggy tunnel providing public URLs accessible from anywhere
- âœ… **SUCCESS!** Complete end-to-end setup working
- âœ… Created comprehensive Pinggy tutorial guide (`docs/pinggy_comfyui_colab_guide.md`)
- âœ… Updated notebook (`gorilla_pinggy_test.ipynb`) with working Pinggy method

**Key Learnings:**
- Pinggy is more reliable than cloudflared for Colab tunneling
- No authentication issues like localtunnel
- Free tier provides public URLs accessible from anywhere
- Proper installation order critical: dependencies â†’ install â†’ import â†’ use

**Final Result:** ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE SUCCESS** - ComfyUI with GPU acceleration running on Colab with public URL access via Pinggy tunneling!
