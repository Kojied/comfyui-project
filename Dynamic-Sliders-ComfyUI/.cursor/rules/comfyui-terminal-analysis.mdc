# ComfyUI Terminal Analysis Rules

## CRITICAL: Terminal Output Analysis Process

When analyzing ComfyUI terminal output, ALWAYS follow this process:

### 1. Wait for Clear Indicators
- ✅ **"Starting server"** = ComfyUI is ready
- ✅ **"To see the GUI go to: [URL]"** = Server is running
- ❌ **No "Starting server" message** = Still loading

### 2. Focus on Most Recent Output
- Look at the **bottom/latest lines** of terminal output
- Ignore old startup logs from previous sessions
- Check timestamps to distinguish old vs new instances

### 3. Verify Before Claiming
- Don't say "ComfyUI is ready" until I see "Starting server"
- Don't provide URLs until I see "To see the GUI go to:"
- Wait for the process to actually complete

### 4. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Mixing up old terminal output with new startup process
- ❌ Claiming ComfyUI is ready when it's still loading
- ❌ Providing URLs before seeing "Starting server"
- ❌ Focusing on middle sections of terminal output instead of latest

### 5. Apply This Everywhere
- ✅ **This session** - Following the process
- ✅ **Future sessions** - Will use the same approach
- ✅ **Any ComfyUI startup** - Will wait for proper indicators
- ✅ **Any server startup** - Will verify before claiming ready

## Example of Correct Analysis:
```
Lines 139-140: "Starting server" + "To see the GUI go to: http://127.0.0.1:8189"
✅ ComfyUI is ready at http://127.0.0.1:8189
```

## Example of Incorrect Analysis:
```
Lines 65-163: Still loading custom nodes, fetching data
❌ ComfyUI is NOT ready yet - wait for "Starting server"
```
